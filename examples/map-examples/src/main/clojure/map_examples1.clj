;; Example - a getter for a key with a numeric value

;; This example shows how to define a getter function that ensures the

(def get-key-a (define-map-get-accessor :a :number))

;; Explcitly call the function

(get-key-a {:a 1})
;; =>
1

;; But lets use the will-work helper to ensure the result is as expected

(will-work 1 get-key-a {:a 1}) 
;; =>

;; Example - a getter with a static default for key :d
 
(def get-key-d (define-map-get-accessor :d :number default 42))

;; This will work
